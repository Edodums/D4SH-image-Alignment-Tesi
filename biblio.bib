  abstract  = {The efficient detection of interesting features is a crucial step for various tasks in Computer Vision. Corners are favored cues due to their two dimensional constraint and fast algorithms to detect them. Recently, a novel corner detection approach, FAST, has been presented which outperforms previous algorithms in both computational performance and repeatability. We will show how the accelerated segment test, which underlies FAST, can be significantly improved by making it more generic while increasing its performance.We do so by finding the optimal decision tree in an extended configuration space, and demonstrating how specialized trees can be combined to yield an adaptive and generic accelerated segment test. The resulting method provides high performance for arbitrary environments and so unlike FAST does not have to be adapted to a specific scene structure. We will also discuss how different test patterns affect the corner response of the accelerated segment test.},

We have assembled 8 datasets, containing 355 images with 18 different stains, resulting in 481 image pairs to be registered. Registration accuracy was evaluated using manually placed landmarks. In total, 256 teams registered for the challenge, 10 submitted the results, and 6 participated in the workshop. Here, we present the results of 7 well-performing methods from the challenge together with 6 well-known existing methods. The best methods used coarse but robust initial alignment, followed by non-rigid registration, used multiresolution, and were carefully tuned for the data at hand. They outperformed off-the-shelf methods, mostly by being more robust. The best methods could successfully register over 98\% of all landmarks and their mean landmark registration accuracy (TRE) was 0.44\% of the image diagonal. The challenge remains open to submissions and all images are available for download.},

  abstract  = {The history of histology indicates that there have been
               significant changes in the techniques used for histological
               staining through chemical, molecular biology assays and
               immunological techniques, collectively referred to as
               histochemistry. Early histologists used the readily available
               chemicals to prepare tissues for microscopic studies; these
               laboratory chemicals were potassium dichromate, alcohol and the
               mercuric chloride to harden cellular tissues. Staining
               techniques used were carmine, silver nitrate, Giemsa, Trichrome
               Stains, Gram Stain and Hematoxylin among others. The purpose of
               this research was to assess past and current literature reviews,
               as well as case studies, with the aim of informing ways in which
               histological stains have been improved in the modern age.
               Results from the literature review has indicated that there has
               been an improvement in histopathology and histotechnology in
               stains used. There has been a rising need for efficient,
               accurate and less complex staining procedures. Many stain
               procedures are still in use today, and many others have been
               replaced with new immunostaining, molecular, non-culture and
               other advanced staining techniques. Some staining methods have
               been abandoned because the chemicals required have been
               medically proven to be toxic. The case studies indicated that in
               modern histology a combination of different stain techniques are
               used to enhance the effectiveness of the staining process.

                 Questa operazione di analisi prevede l'attuazione di diverse fasi di colorazione del campione tramite marcatori specifici al fine di evidenziarne i principali punti di interesse; tuttavia, queste colorazioni possono comportare deformazioni elastiche o permanenti sul campione, rendendo pi{\`u} difficoltosa la loro successiva sequenziazione e comparazione. L'operazione {\`e} inoltre complicata dalla frequente presenza di immagini di dimensione non uniforme.
                 
                 Ad oggi non esiste un software gold standard per il riallineamento di immagini microscopiche bidimensionali e questo progetto di tesi mira a colmare questa lacuna, proponendo un applicativo user-friendly per permettere a medici e biologi di allineare immagini di provini istologici, provenienti da pazienti, al ?ne di valutare la cross-correlazione tra differenti marcatori tumorali.

  abstract = {This article presents a novel scale- and rotation-invariant detector and descriptor, coined SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features). SURF approximates or even outperforms previously proposed schemes with respect to repeatability, distinctiveness, and robustness, yet can be computed and compared much faster. This is achieved by relying on integral images for image convolutions; by building on the strengths of the leading existing detectors and descriptors (specifically, using a Hessian matrix-based measure for the detector, and a distribution-based descriptor); and by simplifying these methods to the essential. This leads to a combination of novel detection, description, and matching steps. The paper encompasses a detailed description of the detector and descriptor and then explores the effects of the most important parameters. We conclude the article with SURF’s application to two challenging, yet converse goals: camera calibration as a special case of image registration, and object recognition. Our experiments underline SURF’s usefulness in a broad range of topics in computer vision.}

  abstract  = {Dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccination effectively induces
               anti-tumor immunity, although in the majority of cases this does
               not translate into a durable clinical response. However, DC
               vaccination is characterized by a robust safety profile, making
               this treatment a potential candidate for effective combination
               cancer immunotherapy. To explore this possibility, understanding
               changes occurring in the tumor microenvironment (TME) upon DC
               vaccination is required. In this line, quantitative and
               qualitative changes in tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs)
               induced by vaccination with autologous tumor lysate/homogenate
               loaded DCs were investigated in a series of 16 patients with
               metastatic melanoma. Immunohistochemistry for CD4, CD8, Foxp3,
               Granzyme B (GZMB), PDL1, and HLA class I was performed in tumor
               biopsies collected before and after DC vaccination. The density
               of each marker was quantified by automated digital pathology
               analysis on whole slide images. Co-expression of markers
               defining functional phenotypes, i.e., Foxp3+ regulatory CD4+ T
               cells (Treg) and GZMB+ cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, was assessed with
               sequential immunohistochemistry. A significant increase of CD8+
               TILs was found in post-vaccine biopsies of patients who were not
               previously treated with immune-modulating cytokines or
               Ipilimumab. Interestingly, along with a maintained tumoral HLA
               class I expression, after DC vaccination we observed a
               significant increase of PDL1+ tumor cells, which significantly
               correlated with intratumoral CD8+ T cell density. This
               observation might explain the lack of a significant concurrent
               cytotoxic reactivation of CD8+ T cell, as measured by the
               numbers of GZMB+ T cells. Altogether these findings indicate
               that DC vaccination exerts an important role in sustaining or de
               novo inducing a T cell inflamed TME. However, the strength of
               the intratumoral T cell activation detected in post-DC therapy
               lesions is lessened by an occurring phenomenon of adaptive
               immune resistance, yet the concomitant PDL1 up-regulation.
               Overall, this study sheds light on DC immunotherapy-induced TME
               changes, lending the rationale for the design of smarter
               immune-combination therapies.},

  abstract = {Summary The correlation of different microscopic imaging techniques alongside with microanalytical methods is crucial to better understand biological processes on a subcellular level. For that, micrographs and chemical maps exhibiting both, very different spatial resolution and field-of-view but also a highly multimodal content has to be co-registered. We developed the ImageJ/Fiji plug-in Correlia that provides an environment for handling multimodal correlative microscopy data. Several linear and nonlinear registration methods using either feature or area-based similarity measures can flexibly be cascaded to align and warp 2D microscopy data sets. The registration of data sets containing light- and electron micrographs as well as chemical maps acquired by secondary-ion mass spectroscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy is demonstrated. Correlia is an open-source tool developed particularly for the registration and analysis of highly multimodal 2D correlative microscopy data. Lay Description If a microscopic object is imaged correlatively by two or more different microscopes the acquired micrographs will have to be overlaid accurately using an image-registration software. In cases of relatively similar image content creating such an overlay is straight-forward but what if the fields-of-view and resolutions of the micrographs differ significantly? What if there are distortions in a micrograph which have to be corrected before creating an overlay? What if furthermore a chemical map shall be overlaid that merely shows regions in which a certain chemical element is present? The rapidly increasing number of applications in correlative microscopy is calling for an easy-to-use and flexible image registration software that can deal with these challenges. Having that in mind, we developed Correlia, an ImageJ/Fiji plug-in that provides an environment for handling multimodal 2D correlative microscopy data-sets. It allows for creating overlays using different registration algorithms that can flexibly be cascaded. In this paper we describe what is happening ‘under the hood’ and give two example data-sets from microbiology which were registered using Correlia. Correlia is open source software and available from www.ufz.de/correlia - including introductory examples, as the authors would like to encourage other scientists to process their individual correlative microscopy data using Correlia.},

The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

It also enables time-lapse studies of entire cell cultures in multiple imaging modalities. We created MIST (Microscopy Image Stitching Tool) for rapid and accurate stitching of large 2D time-lapse mosaics. MIST estimates the mechanical stage model parameters (actuator backlash, and stage repeatability ‘r’) from computed pairwise translations and then minimizes stitching errors by optimizing the translations within a (4r)2 square area. MIST has a performance-oriented implementation utilizing multicore hybrid CPU/GPU computing resources, which can process terabytes of time-lapse multi-channel mosaics 15 to 100 times faster than existing tools. We created 15 reference datasets to quantify MIST’s stitching accuracy. The datasets consist of three preparations of stem cell colonies seeded at low density and imaged with varying overlap (10 to 50\%). The location and size of 1150 colonies are measured to quantify stitching accuracy. MIST generated stitched images with an average centroid distance error that is less than 2\% of a FOV. The sources of these errors include mechanical uncertainties, specimen photobleaching, segmentation, and stitching inaccuracies. MIST produced higher stitching accuracy than three open-source tools. MIST is available in ImageJ at isg.nist.gov.},

               different positions should yield features which correspond to
               the same real-world 3D locations. The efficiency is important
               because this determines whether the detector combined with
               further processing can operate at frame rate. Three advances are
               described in this paper. First, we present a new heuristic for
               feature detection and, using machine learning, we derive a
               feature detector from this which can fully process live PAL
               video using less than 5 percent of the available processing
               time. By comparison, most other detectors cannot even operate at
               frame rate (Harris detector 115 percent, SIFT 195 percent).
               Second, we generalize the detector, allowing it to be optimized
               for repeatability, with little loss of efficiency. Third, we
               carry out a rigorous comparison of corner detectors based on the
               above repeatability criterion applied to 3D scenes. We show
               that, despite being principally constructed for speed, on these
               stringent tests, our heuristic detector significantly
               outperforms existing feature detectors. Finally, the comparison
               demonstrates that using machine learning produces significant
               improvements in repeatability, yielding a detector that is both
               very fast and of very high quality.},
